            <h2>üï∞Ô∏è Random History Facts</h2>
            <div class="test1">
                History is full of odd coincidences, remarkable inventions, and moments that changed the world in unexpected ways.<br><br>

                For instance, <strong>Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing (1969)</strong> than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The pyramid was built around 2560 BCE, while Cleopatra ruled Egypt around 30 BCE ‚Äî a gap of over 2,500 years!<br><br>

                Another curious fact: the <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong> was originally supposed to stand for only 20 years. Built in 1889 for the Paris Exposition, it was meant to be dismantled by 1909. However, it was saved because it proved useful as a <strong>military radio tower</strong>, and today it‚Äôs one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.<br><br>

                In medieval Europe, people often drank <strong>beer instead of water</strong> because water sources were so polluted. Beer was boiled during brewing, which killed off bacteria, making it safer to drink. Even children consumed low-alcohol ‚Äúsmall beer‚Äù daily.<br><br>

                The <strong>shortest war in history</strong> took place in 1896 between Britain and Zanzibar. It lasted only <strong>38 minutes</strong> before Zanzibar surrendered. The conflict started over who would control the island after the death of a pro-British sultan.<br><br>

                Here‚Äôs a fun coincidence: <strong>John Adams and Thomas Jefferson</strong>, both Founding Fathers and U.S. presidents, died on the same day ‚Äî <strong>July 4, 1826</strong>, exactly 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Adams‚Äô last words were reportedly, ‚ÄúThomas Jefferson still survives,‚Äù though Jefferson had passed away just a few hours earlier.<br><br>

                Meanwhile, in ancient Rome, <strong>purple clothing</strong> was a sign of imperial power because the dye used to make it ‚Äî called Tyrian purple ‚Äî was extracted from thousands of tiny sea snails. It was so expensive that only emperors and high-ranking officials could afford it.<br><br>

                During the early 20th century, the <strong>Titanic</strong> was considered unsinkable, but few know that author <strong>Morgan Robertson</strong> wrote a novel in 1898 ‚Äî fourteen years before the disaster ‚Äî titled <em>Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan</em>. The story described a massive ship called the <em>Titan</em> that sank in the North Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. The similarities are eerily close.<br><br>

                In 1815, <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs defeat at Waterloo</strong> was partly due to heavy rain. The wet ground delayed his army‚Äôs movements, giving the British and Prussian forces time to unite. A single night of bad weather helped shape modern European history.<br><br>

                Fast forward to the Cold War: in 1962, during the <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis</strong>, the world came closer than ever to nuclear war ‚Äî but disaster was prevented thanks to a <strong>Soviet submarine officer named Vasili Arkhipov</strong>. He refused to authorize a nuclear torpedo launch that could have started World War III, effectively saving the world.<br>
